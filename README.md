# JavaScript Ball-Game
Welcome to the **JavaScript Ball-Game**! This project demonstrates a simple physics simulation of moving balls within a container, where the balls bounce off the edges off the viewport
and each other. The game is styled with realistic gradients and shadows, and each ball's size is dynamically calculated for universal collision handling.

## Project Features
### 1. Random Movement
Each ball starts with random velocity [1,5) and direction, creating unique paths across the screen.

### 2. Collision Detection
The game detects collisions between the balls and the viewport edges. Balls bounce off in a way that simulates basic physics.

### 3. Dynamic Ball Properties
Each ball's radius is dynamically calculated, allowing the game to accomodate varied ball sized for future flexibility.

### 4. Customizable Design
CSS styling adds realistic gradients and shadows, enhancing each ball's visual appearance and depth.

### 5. Dragging and Hovering Mechanic
When cursor is on ball, it does a slight hovering animation and is able to be dragged anywhere along the screen.

## Project Structure
- **index.html**: HTML structure for the ball container and elements.
- **style.css**: Contains styling for balls, shadows, and animations
- **script.js**: JavaScript logic for ball movement, collision detection, and interactivity.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Manages movement, collision detecting, dragging, and DOM updates.
- **CSS**: Styles the balls with gradients, shadows, and animations.
- **HTML**: Provides the basic structure.

## Future Plans and Features
### This project is a work in progress, with additional features planned:
- **Dynamic changing shadows**: Shadows will change depending on the time of day; a moving sun object will be added.
